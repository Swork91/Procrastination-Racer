# Procrastination-Racer
Final project showing Java knowledge by making a race car game with agile requirements. Done by splitting it into three sprints, one per week. 

## Controls/Options
wasd keys or arrow keys to move, space to start. 
Game window can be resized before starting to play in any resolution. 

## Sprints Used to Complete Project
### Sprint 1 Plan
* Car that goes.
* Car wont go off track.
* Counts laps that the car does.
* Win after x laps. && win scenario like a popup or something. 

### Sprint 2 Plan
* Lap times recorded
* Lap times saved to high score.
* Can load high score data.
* Obstacles in road to avoid.
* Game timer starts when player is ready. (3, 2, 1, GO!)

### Sprint 3 Plan(final version):
* Car feel like an actual car (not a block shuffling around).
* Improve layout. (GridBagLayoutDemo or BoxLayout)
* Handles checked exceptions. 
* Clean (readable) code
* Polymorphism
* More fun
* (optional) Graphics not as bad.

**Final should also have the following if needed:**
* Write Java code that uses variables, arrays, conditional and loop constructs
* Manipulate primitive numeric data and string data using Java operators
* Create Java classes and use object references
* Access the fields and methods of an object
* Manipulate text data using the methods of the String and StringBuilder classes
* Use casting without losing precision or causing errors
* Declare, override, and invoke methods
* Access and create static fields and methods
* Use classes from the java.time and java.time.format packages to format and print the local date and time
* Encapsulate a class using access modifiers and overloaded constructors
* Define and implement a simple class hierarchy
* Demonstrate polymorphism by implementing a Java Interface
* Use a Predicate Lambda expression as the argument to a method
* Handle a checked exception in a Java application
* A GUI because I want one. 
* Saving and loading of data.

# 1.0 Results/Thoughts
A lot of stuff I could've improved still. Nothing's really looks at all like I wanted from the original planning documents. The requirements had to change a lot as I learned what Java (mostly swing) was capable of and what good programming practice would be. I wouldn't want to try and design a GUI with moving components using swing ever again. Especially not a game. I choose something that would interest me instead of creating a bunch of buttons that run different SQL queries. That big game window gave me so much more trouble than a simple grid layout with button would've. 

my Swing experience in short: Making a calculator, good idea. Making a racing game, bad idea.
